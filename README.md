# Movies Go API

## Design a Movies API with Search, Filtering, Pagination, and Sorting

Your task is to design a RESTful API for a movies site that allows users to search, filter, paginate, and sort movies. The API should be designed using Go programming language and a database of your choice.

The API should allow clients to search for movies based on title, genre, and release year. It should also allow clients to filter movies based on one or more genres, and sort movies based on title, release year, or rating.

The API should follow best practices in software engineering and adhere to RESTful design principles. It should also include error handling and should be secure.

## Requirements

Your solution should include the following:

- A Go application that implements the RESTful API.
- A database schema that defines the structure of the movies table.
- A set of endpoints that allows clients to search, filter, paginate, and sort movies.
- API documentation that explains the endpoints, their expected parameters and responses, and any other relevant information.
- Unit tests for the application and any helper functions you may create.
- You are free to use any third-party libraries or frameworks that you find useful, but you should be able to justify your choices. You should also use Git for version control and submit your solution as a Git repository.

#3 Evaluation Criteria

We will evaluate your solution based on the following criteria:

- Compliance with the requirements.
- Code quality, including readability, maintainability, and modularity.
- Use of best practices, including separation of concerns, error handling, security, and scalability.
- Unit test coverage and effectiveness.
- Your ability to justify your choices of libraries and frameworks.

## Submission

Please submit your solution as a Git repository and provide us with a link to it. We will clone your repository and evaluate your solution locally. You should include a README file that explains how to build, run, and test your application.
